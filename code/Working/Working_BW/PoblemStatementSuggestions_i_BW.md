### Number 1)

Joe Smith (fict.), a dear friend of yours since high school, excelled at many things, most notably being fit and active, which likely landed him as a nutrition advisor to the Cardinals (baseball; or choose the sports team of your fancy). Despite the training camp being outside of the city by over an hour, he insists living near the stadium and enjoying the nightlife with the fans that make the team, 'Call this place home!' However, he was never blessed with a nact for managing his finances. So, despite his luxiurious life style and objectively high salary, he often falls into debt. He also claims, that no matter the state of the economy he always gets back into debt, despite making even more in those years. He contacts you, a trusted friend and expert data scientist, and very kindly asks him for some guidance (trusting his entire fate in your hands).

### Number 2)

Your mother, a woman in her late 60s that's approximately 'with-it', is desperate to spend more time with you and your family. So, with whatever savings she currently has, Social Security and other investments/dividends coming in, and odd-jobs she occasionaly scrounges, she insists on moving to the big city where you are. Coming with her, will be all of her old habbits and quirks that are expected to cost more there 'and Heavens forbid if I can't do all of them'. And, per her myriad of requests, insists on living in a specific neighborhood in a specific type of house (one with a tuck-in garage to be precise). Despite the market being in a recession, she insists on moving as soon as she can. However, she defers to you, her 'best data-scientist', to predict how much more money she has to save to get the house of her dreams to and live nearby you.

### Number 3)

Cr√©Co , the up-and-coming (and fictious) credit card company, is keen on exploring trends in debts. They reach out to you, an esteeed data scientist, to explore if overspending in any particular realm of economic commerce is somehow 'condusive' to people falling into debt. They would then want to offer plans with lower initial rates to those people, incentivizing them to use their credit card, and raise rates, tenatively after 90 days for failure to repay their debts.

They later reach out to you, requesting to distinguish between 'market factors' beyond an individual's control and 'personal factors' that are in a person's control.

### Number 4)

Bandibank (fict.), the ancient and somehwat rigid and 'old-schooled' bank in your small city, rumoured to be run by the local mafia, wants to 'send more money back to the Motherland' and raise interest rates more, thinking it will generate more money for them. However, knowing that the economy is in a rut, they are a bit hesitant to do so. So, they contact you, the grandchild of an old 'associate', to predict how much money they hope to raise as interest rates change. Additionally, a cold hard object touches your back and one man leans into your ear whipsering, "We also wanna know what types of fellas won't go swimmin' with da fishes, if ya catch my drift?" You gulp and get going on your work.

### Number 5)
Note, this one in particular seems like it could easily go both ways. I'll write it from the perspective of mortgage though.

A local eccentric millionaire with no heirs recently passed away. In his will, he shares an anecdote of how poor he was growing up and the crippling debt his family had. One day, a kind man gave him a loan and advice to get him on his feet and within a short number of years got out of debt and a decade later was making his first 100k (back in those years that was a lot). Tried he did to no avail to find this man, yet he was never succuesful. At the least, he wanted to honour his memory by doing the same to others - by helping them out with their {mortgage}, the biggest purchase most people will ever make.

Despite being so advanced in his years, he was always interested in machine learning and was fascinated by them. Anyways, he requested in his will to allocate the money to local families to aid them in their downpoints in a way that will maximize the amount of families helped, each one getting an equal amount, within {3 years} of his death. The board selects you, knowing that after playing chess games with each other at a local bookstore, you two would discuss various data science topics, always leaving with a smile on his face (even after loosing the game of chess).

### Number 6)
Note, this one as well seems like it could easily go both ways. I'll write it from the perspective of mortgage though.

We could honstly place this same scenario at the state or national level too. However, I think it'd be kind of neat to do it on the local level because then we could contrast being generalities called the national average and much more nuanced and potentially totally different subset called a city. Perhaps relevant to a state (so we'd choose one) too.

A growing cohort of busibodies, I mean the city council, is alarmed at growing trends of foreclosures in your city. They reached out to one of the local banks and asked if they could share some details of the people that foreclosed. They were convinced with the 'statistical analysis' they ran that it's entirely the fault of those people themselves that foreclosed. So, they wanted to draft financial advice to people to: #1 Recover from such siutations and #2 Not get into such situations in the first place. They reach out to you, a respected member of the community that works as a data scientist, distinguished with the ability to explain lofty concepts to a non-technical audience, to confirm their findings and present what they are confident about at the next city council meeting.

### Number 7)

50Action_News! (fict.), a national news outlet, has a sterling reputation for accuracy in whatever they report. They recently got information about how the economy is booming and everything is going great. Being skeptical, and per their policy of being thorough, they outsource investigating this claim to you, the lead data scientist in a similarily acclaimed consulting firm, to investigate the veracity of these claims and predict what kinds of people are the most likely to fall into debt.
